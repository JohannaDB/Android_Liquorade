# Liquorade

Liquorade is a simple Android application built in Kotlin and uses Retrofit, Room, Moshi, Glide and Dagger2. 
The Liquorade app is an on-the-go guide for anyone who loves a good cocktail. 
In the app you can find a large collection of cocktails sorted by their main ingredient, but you can also let the app decide what you\'re going to drink.
The Liquorade app uses data from the TheCocktailDB (www.thecocktaildb.com) database.

- [Retrofit:](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) Used to simplify the api calls / HTTP communication.  
- [Room:](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) Used to store data locally.  
- [Moshi:](https://github.com/square/moshi) Used to parse JSON to Kotlin data objects.  
- [Glide:](https://bumptech.github.io/glide/) Used to load and cache images by URL.  
- [Dagger 2:](https://dagger.dev/) Used for dependency injection.
